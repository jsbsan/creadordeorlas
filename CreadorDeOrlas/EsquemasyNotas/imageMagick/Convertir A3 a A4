 Scaling a pdf file from A3 to A4
This is just a quick tip for converting a pdf file from one pagesize to another.
By using the command convert this is easily achieved.

This is the quickest way I've found to do this:


convert -page a3 infile.pdf -page a4 outfile.pdf

The outfile.pdf should now be sized as an A4 page.
The command is as follows: convert [input file options] infile.pdf [output file options] outfile.pdf

Of course it is possible to convert to and from other sizes as well.
